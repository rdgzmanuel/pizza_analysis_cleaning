# pizza_analysis_cleaning
Similar analysis to pizza_analysis but in this case we are presented with a messy Dataset, so we have to clean it before starting to analyse it.
The assumptions made in this analysis are also the same made in the analysis of 2015, i.e. i have considered that the ingredients only last one week after being
purchased and the profit margin is 15%. That means that the functions used to analyse the data are the same, I have only added some new ones to clean the data
in order to being able to use the previous function another time.
